# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ #
Hello there! My name is Arzekeil (pronouced R -- Zee -- Key -- ill) and I'm a second year Computer Science student attending Wilfrid Laurier University. I'm interested in everything tech but have found the most interest in automation. I'm currently looking for internships for the summer 2022 season related to automation, devops engineering and software development.

## Currently Learning ðŸ“š ##

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/latex-%23008080.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=latex&logoColor=white)

I learned to love automation during my first tech role working as a QA Tester. I found it so cool how I was to be able to run a few commands and then it would complete a bunch of tasks by its self. This is what I am currently learning how to use **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Ansible** and **Jenkins 2** to become a DevOps Engineer.
