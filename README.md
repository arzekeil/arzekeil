<h3>
  About me ðŸŽ™
</h3>
<p>
  My name is Arzekeil and I'm a second year Computer Science student attending Wilfrid Laurier University. I'm interested in everything tech but have found the most   interest in automation. I'm currently looking for internships for the summer 2022 season related to automation, devops engineering and software development.

<h3>
  What am I learning? ðŸ“š
</h3>
<p>
  I'm currently working at TD Bank as a Quality Engineer. Besides that, I've been studying the public cloud technologies, specifically Azure. I've been interested in the cloud and automation for a while and as such I plan to learn Linux and automation technologies more (Kubernetes, Terraform and Ansible).
</p>

<p>
  I learned to love automation during my first tech role working as a QA Tester. I found it so cool how I was to be able to run a few commands and then it would complete a bunch of tasks by its self. This is why I'm hoping to learn more Infrastructure as Code technologies and help solve the problem of eliminating or at least reducing latency in software development.
