# 🤗 Hi, I'm Arzekeil  

## 🫡 About Me  
I'm a Computer Science student nearing the completion of my degree at Wilfrid Laurier University, where I'm driven by a passion for transforming data into catalysts for positive change. Whether I’m analyzing complex datasets or scaling new heights on the rock wall, I bring the same energy and determination to every challenge, be it in bouldering, top roping, or uncovering the stories hidden in the numbers.
  
## 🦉 My Projects  

### 🖥️ [Home Lab](https://github.com/arzekeil/home-lab)  
Developed a home lab environment to not only simulate data analysis workflows but allow for some private game server hosting.
